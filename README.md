üõ†Ô∏è Git Workflow Summary

We followed a Feature Branch Workflow:
main branch kept stable & deployable.
New features/pages were developed on separate branches (e.g., feature/home-page, feature/contact-form).

Pull Requests (PRs) were used for merging into main.
Merge conflicts were resolved collaboratively.
Key Git Commands Used:
git checkout -b feature/about-page ‚Üí Create new branch for About page
git add . ‚Üí Stage changes
git commit -m "feat: add responsive contact form" ‚Üí Commit with clear message
git push origin feature/about-page ‚Üí Push branch to GitHub
git pull origin main ‚Üí Sync with main before merging

üîç Reflection
Benefits of GitHub: Enabled collaboration, version tracking, and organized workflow.
Challenges: Merge conflicts in CSS and HTML files, solved by careful manual resolution.
Future Improvements: Use issue tracking more strictly, commit more frequently, and possibly adopt a CSS framework like Bootstrap/Tailwind for faster styling.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project strengthened our understanding of:
Web design fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Collaborative version control using Git/GitHub
Conflict resolution and team coordination

The final product meets the course requirements and demonstrates teamwork and proper code management practices.
